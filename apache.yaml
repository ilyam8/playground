        text: |
          If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions:

          - Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file.
          - Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
