### Dramatic performance and stability improvements, with a smaller agent footprint <a id="v1380-dbenginev2"></a>

We completely reworked our custom-made, time series database (dbengine), resulting in stunning improvements to performance, scalability, and stability, while at the same time significantly reducing the [agent memory requirements](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/database/engine#memory-requirements). 

On production-grade hardware (e.g. 48 threads, 32GB ram) Netdata Agent Parents can easily collect 2 million points/second while servicing data queries for 10 million points / second, and running ML training and Health querying 1 million points / second each!
